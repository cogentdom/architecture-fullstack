## 🐛 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Please DO NOT:
- Open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- Disclose the vulnerability publicly before it has been addressed

### Please DO:
1. **Report via GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred):
   - Go to the repository's Security tab
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details

2. **Or email directly** (if GitHub reporting is not available):
   - Email: [your-email@example.com]
   - Subject: [SECURITY] Brief description
   - Include detailed information about the vulnerability

### What to Include:
- Type of vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability (what an attacker could achieve)

## 📝 Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Status Updates**: Every 7 days until resolved
- **Resolution**: Varies based on severity and complexity

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Current Implementation

1. **Docker Isolation**: Application runs in isolated containers
2. **Read-Only External APIs**: No write operations to Yahoo Finance
3. **Input Validation**: Basic ticker symbol validation
4. **Dependency Management**: Pinned versions in requirements.txt

### Known Limitations

1. **No Authentication**: Dashboard is publicly accessible (suitable for development)
2. **No Rate Limiting**: No built-in protection against DoS
3. **HTTP Only**: Default setup uses HTTP (not HTTPS)

## 🚀 Recommended Security Enhancements for Production

### Essential
1. **HTTPS/SSL**: 
   - Use Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates
   - Configure Nginx with SSL termination
   - Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS

2. **Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication (OAuth, JWT)
   - Consider Streamlit's built-in authentication
   - Use environment variables for secrets

3. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Never commit these to version control
   export API_KEY="your-secret-key"
   export DATABASE_URL="your-db-connection"
   ```

### Recommended
4. **Firewall Configuration**:
   - Only expose ports 80 and 443
   - Use AWS Security Groups to restrict access
   - Consider VPN for administrative access

5. **Container Security**:
   - Run containers as non-root user
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities (Trivy, Snyk)
   - Keep base images updated
   - Use minimal base images (alpine, slim)

6. **Network Security**:
   - Implement rate limiting (Nginx or application level)
   - Use fail2ban for brute force protection
   - Consider WAF (Web Application Firewall)

7. **Secrets Management**:
   - Use AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Rotate credentials regularly

8. **Monitoring & Logging**:
   - Centralized logging (ELK stack, CloudWatch)
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activity
   - Regular security audits

### Advanced
9. **Dependency Scanning**:
   ```bash
   # Regular vulnerability scanning
   pip install safety
   safety check -r requirements.txt
   ```

10. **OWASP Best Practices**:
    - Regular security assessments
    - Input sanitization
    - CSRF protection
    - Content Security Policy headers

## 🔍 Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

Upon receiving a security vulnerability report:

1. We will confirm receipt within 48 hours
2. We will investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. We will develop and test a fix
4. We will release a security patch
5. We will publicly acknowledge the reporter (if desired)
6. We will update this security policy and CHANGELOG
